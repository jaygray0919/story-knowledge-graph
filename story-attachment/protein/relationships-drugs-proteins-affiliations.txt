https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2238928/
Orthologs are genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation.
For example, 18,968 human genes have orthologs among 11 vertebrates (chimpanzee, mouse, cow, chicken, zebrafish, etc.)

Pfam domains

Pfam is a classification of protein families.
It is used by experimental biologists researching specific proteins, by structural biologists to identify new targets for structure determination, by computational biologists to organize sequences and by evolutionary biologists tracing the origins of proteins.
