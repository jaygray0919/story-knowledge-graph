Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid discovery of a safe and effective vaccine is an essential issue, consequently, this study aims to predict potential COVID-19 peptide-based vaccine utilizing
  the Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N)
  and Spike Glycoprotein (S)
  via the Immunoinformatics approach.

To achieve this goal, several Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) tools, molecular docking, and safety prediction servers were used.

According to the results, The Spike peptide peptides SQCVNLTTRTQLPPAYTNSFTRGVY is predicted to have the highest binding affinity to the B-Cells.

The Spike peptide FTISVTTEI has the highest binding affinity to the MHC I HLA-B1503 allele.

The Nucleocapsid peptides KTFPPTEPK and RWYFYYLGTGPEAGL have the highest binding affinity to the MHC I HLA-A0202 allele and the three MHC II alleles HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*02:01, HLA-DQA1*01:02/DQB1-*06:02, HLA-DRB1, respectively.

Furthermore, those peptides were predicted as non-toxic and non-allergen.

Therefore, the combination of those peptides is predicted to stimulate better immunological responses with respectable safety.
